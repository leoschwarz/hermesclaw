# Contributing to HermesClaw

Thank you for your interest in contributing. HermesClaw is a community-maintained implementation of Hermes Agent (NousResearch) running inside NVIDIA OpenShell, and we want it to be a reliable reference for anyone who wants to run a sandboxed Hermes agent.

## What we're building

HermesClaw has three layers:

1. **OpenShell integration** — policy YAML files, profile, and the `hermesclaw` CLI that wraps `openshell` commands
2. **Hermes configuration** — `hermes.yaml.example`, `persona.yaml.example`, Dockerfile, docker-compose
3. **Documentation** — feature reference, comparison table, test results

The most valuable contributions are in this order:
- **Correctness fixes** — wrong OpenShell policy schema, wrong CLI flags, broken commands
- **Real-world testing** — if you've run HermesClaw on actual NVIDIA hardware, test reports are gold
- **New policy presets** — for specific use cases (homeassistant, coding, research, etc.)
- **New platform policies** — Slack, WhatsApp, Signal network rules
- **Docs improvements** — anything that makes setup easier for a new user

---

## Ways to contribute

### Report a bug

Use the **Bug Report** issue template. Include:
- Output of `./scripts/doctor.sh`
- Output of `./scripts/hermesclaw doctor`
- Whether you're on OpenShell or Docker mode
- OS and OpenShell version

### Request a feature

Use the **Feature Request** template. The most welcome requests:
- Additional policy presets for specific use cases
- New platform integrations in the gateway policy
- Missing OpenShell CLI features in the `hermesclaw` wrapper
- Hermes configuration improvements

### Fix a bug or improve docs

Small fixes (typos, broken links, wrong commands) → open a PR directly.

Larger changes → open an issue first to discuss the approach.

### Improve OpenShell policy correctness

If you work at NVIDIA or have access to OpenShell internals, correctness fixes to the policy YAML schema are extremely valuable. The schema in `openshell/hermesclaw-policy.yaml` is our best effort from the public docs — if anything is wrong, please send a PR.

---

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- bash 4+ (macOS: `brew install bash`)
- git
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU + OpenShell for full sandbox testing

### Clone and verify

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAiSingularity/hermesclaw
cd hermesclaw

# Run diagnostics on the repo itself (no model needed)
./scripts/doctor.sh --quick

# Run the feature comparison test suite
./scripts/test.sh --quick
```

Both should complete without any `FAIL` entries (some `WARN` entries are expected if OpenShell/llama.cpp aren't installed).

### Validate YAML files

```bash
# Requires: pip install pyyaml
python3 -c "
import yaml, sys, glob
for f in glob.glob('**/*.yaml', recursive=True):
    try:
        yaml.safe_load(open(f))
        print(f'OK  {f}')
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        print(f'ERR {f}: {e}')
        sys.exit(1)
"
```

### Lint shell scripts

```bash
# Requires: brew install shellcheck (macOS) or apt-get install shellcheck (Linux)
shellcheck scripts/hermesclaw scripts/setup.sh scripts/start.sh scripts/status.sh scripts/doctor.sh scripts/test.sh
```

### Test Docker build

```bash
# Build the hermesclaw container image
docker build -t hermesclaw:latest .

# Verify Hermes is installed inside
docker run --rm hermesclaw:latest hermes version

# Full compose test (CPU mode)
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
docker exec hermesclaw hermes status
docker compose down
```

## Making changes

### Branch naming

```
fix/policy-yaml-schema-v2
feat/homeassistant-policy-preset
docs/inference-routing-guide
test/live-gateway-test
```

Format: `<type>/<short-description>` using kebab-case.

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `refactor`, `chore`

### Commit messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
fix(policy): correct Landlock compatibility field to best_effort
feat(preset): add homeassistant policy preset
docs(features): document voice note transcription for Discord
test(doctor): add jq fallback for JSON parsing
ci: add shellcheck to GitHub Actions
```

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description in imperative mood>`

- Use present tense: "add", "fix", "update" — not "added", "fixed", "updated"
- Keep subject under 72 characters
- Add a body if the change is non-obvious

### One concern per PR

A PR that fixes a policy YAML schema issue should only fix that. A PR that adds a new preset should only add that preset and its documentation. Mixing unrelated changes makes review harder and slows merges.

---

## Testing

### Before every PR

Run both scripts and make sure there are no new `FAIL` entries:

```bash
./scripts/doctor.sh --quick
./scripts/test.sh --quick
```

### When changing policy YAML

Validate the schema:
```bash
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('openshell/hermesclaw-policy.yaml'))"
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('openshell/policy-strict.yaml'))"
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('openshell/policy-gateway.yaml'))"
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('openshell/policy-permissive.yaml'))"
```

### When changing shell scripts

```bash
shellcheck scripts/hermesclaw scripts/setup.sh scripts/start.sh scripts/status.sh scripts/doctor.sh scripts/test.sh
```

### When changing docker-compose.yml

```bash
docker compose config   # validates and prints resolved config
docker compose build    # builds the hermesclaw image
docker compose up -d    # starts the stack
./scripts/doctor.sh     # full check (no --quick)
docker compose down
```

### If you have OpenShell

If you have NVIDIA hardware and OpenShell installed, run the full test:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/start.sh
./scripts/hermesclaw doctor
./scripts/hermesclaw chat "hello, verify you can respond"
./scripts/hermesclaw policy-set gateway
./scripts/hermesclaw stop
```

Include your `./scripts/doctor.sh` output in the PR body.

### Regenerate test-results.md

After any change to the test suite or feature status:
```bash
./scripts/test.sh --quick
git add docs/test-results.md
```

## Pull request process

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** — one concern per PR
3. **Run the tests** — `./scripts/doctor.sh --quick` and `./scripts/test.sh --quick`
4. **Lint your scripts** — `shellcheck` on any modified `.sh` or `hermesclaw` files
5. **Validate any YAML** — `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('your-file.yaml'))"`
6. **Update docs** if your change adds or removes a feature — update `docs/features.md` and regenerate `docs/test-results.md`
7. **Open the PR** using the PR template — fill in all sections
8. **One approval** required before merge (from a maintainer or trusted contributor)

### PR checklist (enforced by template)

- [ ] `./scripts/doctor.sh --quick` passes with no new FAIL entries
- [ ] `./scripts/test.sh --quick` runs to completion
- [ ] `shellcheck` passes on any modified shell scripts
- [ ] All modified YAML files parse without errors
- [ ] `docs/test-results.md` regenerated if feature coverage changed
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `[Unreleased]`

## Code standards

### Shell scripts

- All scripts start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- All scripts use `set -euo pipefail` (except where specific checks need to fail silently — document why)
- Variables are always quoted: `"$VAR"`, not `$VAR`
- Local variables declared with `local` inside functions
- Color codes defined as named variables at the top, never inline
- Error messages go to stderr: `echo "..." >&2`
- No hardcoded paths that won't work across environments — use `$SCRIPT_DIR` patterns
- No `cat` piped to `grep` — use `grep file` directly
- No backticks — use `$(...)` for command substitution

### YAML files

- 2-space indentation throughout
- Comments explain *why*, not *what* (the YAML already shows what)
- Every file has a header comment with purpose, usage, and reference link
- String values are quoted when they contain special characters
- Lists always use `-` with a space, never inline `[a, b, c]` for multi-item lists

### Documentation

- Markdown only — no HTML except where GitHub doesn't render Markdown (e.g., centered images)
- Code blocks always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- CLI commands are always wrapped in code blocks
- Links use relative paths for internal docs, absolute URLs for external
- No duplicate information — if something is in `docs/features.md`, link to it from `README.md` rather than copying it

## What we won't merge

- **Changes that weaken security without a documented justification** — e.g., opening up the network policy without a clear use case
- **Dockerfile changes that add root execution** — Hermes must run as an unprivileged user
- **Breaking changes to the `hermesclaw` CLI** without a deprecation path — existing users depend on `hermesclaw start/stop/status/connect`
- **Secret sprawl** — never add API keys, tokens, or credentials to any file that isn't in `.gitignore`
- **Untested changes** — if you can't run `./scripts/doctor.sh --quick` successfully, we can't merge
- **Large scope creep** — HermesClaw is specifically Hermes + OpenShell. We won't merge general-purpose Hermes improvements unrelated to the sandbox

## Questions?

Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/TheAiSingularity/hermesclaw/discussions) for anything that isn't a bug report or feature request. This is the right place for:
- "Is this the right approach for X?"
- "Has anyone gotten Y working?"
- "What's the roadmap for Z?"
